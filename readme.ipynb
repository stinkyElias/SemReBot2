    "## Requirements\n",
    "- Dedicated GPU with min. 9 GB memory\n",
    "- ~30 GB storage\n",
    "- CUDA version 11.8+\n",
    "- Docker\n",
    "- Python3.8+\n",

    "## Setup (Ubuntu)\n",
    "1. Install `pytorch` for `Python 3.8+`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    CUDA 11.8\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118\n",
